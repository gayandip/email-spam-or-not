# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Check

## Overview

This repository hosts an **Email Spam Check** machine learning model, designed to accurately classify incoming emails as either legitimate (ham) or spam. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model analyzes the text content of emails to identify patterns indicative of spam, helping users maintain a cleaner and safer inbox.

## Model Details

Our model utilizes a **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)** algorithm, a probabilistic classifier particularly well-suited for text classification tasks due to its effectiveness with discrete features (like word counts in emails).

## Performance Metrics

The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using key metrics to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

| Metric    | Score  |
